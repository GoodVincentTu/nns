# Introduction

## What is NNS?
NNS is the NEO Name Service, a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the NEO blockchain.  
NNS is to map human-readable names like ‘alice.eth’ to machine-readable identifiers such as NEO addresses, content hashes, and metadata. NNS also supports ‘reverse resolution’, making it possible to associate metadata such as canonical names or interface descriptions with NEO addresses.

NNS has similar goals to DNS, the Internet’s Domain Name Service, but has significantly different architecture, due to the capabilities and constraints provided by the NEO blockchain. Like DNS, NNS operates on a system of dot-separated hierarchial names called domains, with the owner of a domain having full control over the allocation of subdomains.

Top-level domains, like ‘.neo’ are owned by smart contracts called registrars, which specify rules governing the allocation of their subdomains. Anyone may, by following the rules imposed by these registrar contracts, obtain ownership of a second-level domain for their own use.
